# Felt JS SDK React Starter

This repo shows how you can use the [Felt JS SDK](https://github.com/felt/js-sdk) with React to interact with embedded Felt maps.

- [Documentation](https://developers.felt.com/js-sdk)
- [API Reference](https://developers.felt.com/js-sdk-api-reference)

## Getting started

To run the project, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.

## Notes

This example uses `vite` to run the project and `@chakra-ui/react` for UI components.

To use Chakra UI, you'll probably need to consult these parts of the docs:

- [Components](https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/concepts/overview)
- [Styling](https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/styling/overview)
- [Theming](https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/overview)

## Kelsey's Notes

Implemented dropdown using [Chakra-UI Select (Native) Component](https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/native-select)
