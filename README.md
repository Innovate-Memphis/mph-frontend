# Felt JS SDK React Starter

This repo shows how you can use the Felt JS SDK to interact with embedded Felt maps.

The preelease documentation is available [here](https://felt-1.gitbook.io/prerelease-api/sbIy6fOyyRJ35iaR2jim/js-api/main)

To run the project, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.

## Notes

This example uses `vite` to run the project and `@chakra-ui/react` for UI components.

To use Chakra UI, you'll probably need to consult these parts of the docs:

- [Components](https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/concepts/overview)
- [Styling](https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/styling/overview)
- [Theming](https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/overview)
